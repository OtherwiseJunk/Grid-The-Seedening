# The WORKDIR is already set to /workspaces/Grid-The-Seedening in the base image,
# which is where VS Code will mount your project.

# This Dockerfile is now much simpler because the dev container's entrypoint
# and lifecycle are managed by the devcontainer.json configuration
# (e.g., using `postCreateCommand` to run `npm install`).
# The base image's default command keeps the container alive.
